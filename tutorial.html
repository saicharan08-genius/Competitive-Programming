      <h2>Basics for Competitive Programming</h2>
      <p>This will cover <a href = "https://time-complexity.saicharanmugunt.repl.co/">Time Complexity</a>(Best case Time Complxity, Worst Case Time Complexity), Simulation problems which are very common in basic Competitive Programming Problems like in the USACO Bronze Problems and also Rectangle Geometry</p>

      <h2>Complete Search</h2>
      <p>In many Competitive Programming problems, it suffices to check all possible cases in a solution space, wether it be all elements, all pairs of elements, or all subsets, or all pemutations. Unsurprisingly, this is called complete search which is also called brute force because it completely searches the solution space.</p>

      <h2>Basic Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
      <p> 
        This covers Data Structures in C++(vector, array, pairs, and tuples) and in Python(list, dictionary, array, tuples)and algorithms in C++ and Python(sort, search etc.)

      <h2>Ad Hoc</h2>
      <p>Most bronze problems fall into specific categories, such as simulation and complete search. Those which don't often require more thought, although they are not necessarily more difficult to implement.Any problem that doesn't fall under any well-defined category can be labelled as Ad Hoc. Since there is no fixed algorithm or idea to solving these problems, they can be hard to generalize. In this module, we'll go over some general tips that may be useful in approaching these problems.</p>

      <h2>Intro to Greedy Algorithms</h2>
      <p>Some USACO Bronze problems that appear to be Ad Hoc can actually be solved using greedy algorithms. This idea will be covered in a future module, but we'll introduce the general mindset in this section.</p>

      <h2>Intro to Graphs</h2>
      <p>Graphs can be used to represent many things, from images to wireless signals, but one of the simplest analogies is to a map. Consider a map with several cities and bidirectional roads connecting the cities. Some problems relating to graphs are:</p>
